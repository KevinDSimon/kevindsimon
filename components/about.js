      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>I am Kevin Simon – a Senior UI designer. I care deeply about creating intuitive and beautiful products that help people accomplish their goals quickly and stress-free. I like to be involved in all stages of a project. From concept, through research and wireframes, high-fidelity designs, and even front-end development.</p>

      <p>I am based in Chicago, IL where I live with my beautiful fiancé Carrie. My professional career began in 2012 as a Graphic Designer at Vivid Seats–an event ticket marketplace. After 3 years, I joined Centro–one of the leaders in digital advertising in the summer of 2015. As a Senior UI Designer, I've developed and extended a system of design standards across Centro’s product suite while producing features and enhancements in order to simplify and speed up experiences for internal and external clients.</p>

      <p>I understand that the perfect user interface looks good, but works even better due to my passion for clean design and code.</p>
