      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>I am Kevin Simon, a Product Designer from Chicago, now based in Metro Detroit. I care deeply about creating intuitive and beautiful products that help people accomplish their goals quickly and stress-free. I practice user centered design, and love being involved in every facet of product development: research, concepting, prototyping, validation, high-fidelity design, development, and measurement.</p>

      <p>My career began in 2012 as a Graphic Designer at Vivid Seats, an event ticket marketplace. After three years, I joined Centro in the summer of 2015, a leader in digital advertising. As a Senior UI Designer, I developed and extended a system of design standards across Centro’s product suite while designing new features and enhancements in order to simplify and speed up experiences for both internal and external clients. Four years later, I joined ActiveCampaign as a Product Designer. At ActiveCampaign, I lead our mobile apps experience offering small to medium sized businesses an on-the-go customer experience automation solution.</p>

      <p>I understand a great design looks good, but works even better.</p>
